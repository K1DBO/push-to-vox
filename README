version 1.0.0

Push-to-VOX will automatically enable and disable VOX control on
your Flex 6000 series radio.  It can be controlled with your mouse or
keyboard through its on screen interface or with a serial port
connected footswitch.

Push-to-VOX does as its name implies.  Rather than simply acting like
another MOX button, Push-to-VOX will enable VOX control when the
footswitch is depressed and disable it when the footswitch is
released.  Alternately, you can use a quick tap of your foot to enable
or disable VOX.  The settings panel will let you tailor the behavior
to your liking.  If VOX operation is not desired, but the quick tap
feature is, select 'Push to MOX' instead of 'Push to VOX'.  Timers are
available to latch the current mode after the footswitch has been
depressed for longer than the preset time period.  A quick tap of the
footswitch will release the latch.

The footswitch wiring is the same as what's used with SmartSDR CAT to
map an "Existing" COM port for PTT.  Its a very simple cable.  Wire
it so your PTT switch will short pins 7 and 8.  This will raise CTS on
the COM port and activate the transmitter.

Also included is an ID timer to obnoxiusly remind you to reset it
every 10 minutes.
